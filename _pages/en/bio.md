**Ramastons** is a rock band born in El Vendrell, Catalonia, on 2010.
A series of coincidences joined the four members in order to find a style that identifies them, starting with the diversity of styles of each of the components.

From their very first origins, the band has wanted to find a new experience in the genre, taking their own personal vision and interpretation of Rock, learning of greatest bands like ACDC, Rolling Stones, Guns ‘n’ Roses, Beatles, Led Zeppellin, Oasis and many other.

On 2014, Ramastons releases their first EP “Feel Alive”.

Feeling, energy and nonconformity become the three essential elements that identify the band and their songs.

On July 2014, the band was awarded as the “Best band of Baix Penedès” of the musical contest Track El Vendrell.

During September 2014, a new drummer joined the band, Marc Muñoz, after the quit of Albert Garriga, who was looking for new personal projects.

On 2015, although the band was present on many stages, like Festa Major of Igualada, they’ve found the time to start a new project that is expected to end on 2017 as a new Album.
